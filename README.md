# axios
This project demonstrates the features of Axios which is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the project. 
>The AXIOS is used for following purposes:
   >> 1. Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
   >> 2. Make http requests from node.js
   >> 3. Supports the Promise API
   >>4. Intercept request and response
   >> 5. Transform request and response data
   >> 6. Cancel requests
   >> 7. Automatic transforms for JSON data
   >> 8. Client side support for protecting against XSRF
